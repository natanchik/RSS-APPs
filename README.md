## Hello! 
## Welcome to my RSS APPs Repository!

There are next works:
- Car Racing &#128681; - game, where you can manage the collection of the cars and organize races.  
  This game uses REST API.  
  Before you start, you have to setup and run [server](https://github.com/mikhama/async-race-api).  
  Then you can open [game](https://natanchik.github.io/RSS-Tasks/async-race/) and race!

  
- Minesweeper &#128241; - a puzzle video game. Just [open](https://natanchik.github.io/RSS-Tasks/minesweeper/) and play!

- RSS-CSS-Selector &#128212; - you can train your knowledge about CSS selectors by playing this [game](https://natanchik.github.io/RSS-Tasks/rss-css-selectors/)!

- Self-introduction video &#127909; - in this [presentation](https://natanchik.github.io/RSS-Tasks/self-introduction/) I'm telling about myself.
  
- Machine Learninhg presentation &#127916; - this [presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ao-3g9iUUW4) provides a brief overview of machine learning.  
  Slides from presentation are [here](https://natanchik.github.io/Presentation_ML/).

- News API &#128250; - is a simple HTTP REST API for searching and retrieving news from around the Internet.  
  My task was migrate an application from JavaScript to TypeScript and add adaptive design.  
  The result you can see [here](https://natanchik.github.io/RSS-Tasks/migration-newip-to-ts/)
