## Hello! 
## Welcome to my RSS APPs Repository!

There are next works:
- Car Racing &#128681; - game, where you can manage the collection of the cars and organize races.  
  This game uses REST API.  
  Before you start, you have to setup and run [server](https://github.com/mikhama/async-race-api).  
  Then you can open [game](https://async-car-racing-game.netlify.app/) and race!
