[My self-introduction video](https://youtu.be/oQvBx7OtrxI)

Hello! My name is Natalya and this video is about me and what inspires me.

I was born in St. Petersburg in Russia and graduated from St. Petersburg State University of Architecture and Civil Engineering. 

Last year I moved to Almaty, Kazakhstan.

Some time ago I decided to move to a new field of work for me: to become a programmer.

At first, my programming path contained Python, SQL, Docker, etc. 

Now it's filled with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and more.

This spring, a JavaScript/Frontend course from RSS School burst into my life, robbing me of sleep and rest. Now I have a burning fire of lust for knowledge and new achievements.

I code when I sleep, walk, 	enjoy the view of nature, I rest too with my laptop in hand. My mornings begin with checking my RSS School account. My outings outdoors, accompanied by coffee and exciting lectures by seasoned progers. 

Now I have a strong community, which helps me to keep going, without stopping and without falling down when difficulties arise. Sometimes my brain explodes or I get stuck, but I always manage to find a way out and cope with the problem. Then comes the joy and satisfaction of the result obtained. Such moments help me move forward with renewed vigor and continue to create. 

Every morning my workplace waits for me and inspires me to advance in my self-study. And I am sure that one day my dream will come true, and I will become a great professional. Who will be able to help and guide new specialists at the beginning of the path, as our mentors, activists and just those who are also going down this path, but are already ahead. It's very cool and extremely inspiring. Thank you very much to them!

I love teamwork, but I also value solitude and peace. A cup of coffee and some cookies would be great company) Sweets charge my brain and raise my spirits. So, I want to join in more and more).

Before me the whole world has opened, and I'm at the beginning of the road. It may not be easy, but the main thing is to make a start and hit the road. I am sure that I will have many interesting adventures along the way, successful projects, new friends and happy moments.

I will be happy to share this journey with someone else! Together it is much more interesting to cope with difficulties and conquer new heights!

Thank you all and good luck!
